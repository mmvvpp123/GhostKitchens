# GhostKitchen

[Javadocs](https://nimatullo.github.io/GhostKitchen/docs/)

## Project breakdown
My tech stack includes Spring, React and Postgresql. My Spring application has REST endpoints that are exposed which my frontend can leverage. The frontend also consists of 3 different React apps that work as a micro frontend.

## Features
1. User creation and authentication using JSON Web Tokens
2. Support for multiple roles such as customer, owner, delivery person
3. Adding menu items to cart
4. Adding menu items to restaurant
5. Checkout
6. Accepting and completing deliveries

## Todo & things I'd do differently
1. Deploy application using Docker
2. Format the React so coding API requests would easier
